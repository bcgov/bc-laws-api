# bc-laws-api

BC Laws is a portal application that has been developed by the Queen's Printer of British Columbia to access BC provincial legislation. BC Laws is a modern alternative to traditional methods of online publishing which provides feature rich content in a machine consumable format (XML). 

## Features
BC Laws contains a comprehensive collection of BC legislation and related materials. It is available on the internet in two forms:



1. The library is available as a web site in which users can browse and search the laws of British Columbia.


1. The library is available as a portal to legislation in raw XML1 data format, accessible via the BC Laws API2. This direct access to raw data is intended to enable third parties to build or add their own custom applications based on the structure of the data and all the associated search functionality inherent in that structure. The BC Laws website itself is an example of one such application.
## Usage
BC provincial legislation can be accessed and published through our [Application Programming Interface (API)](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/template/complete/api/index.html), providing access to a significant amount of detailed legislative content. The BC Laws API is consumed by the Queen's Printer of British Columbia in it's web applications, including: [http://www.bclaws.ca/](http://www.bclaws.ca/)

The API content is available through a permissive license which we hope will encourage citizens and companies to create new value added services further enabling citizen legislative access: [http://www.bclaws.ca/standards/2014/QP-License_1.0.html](http://www.bclaws.ca/standards/2014/QP-License_1.0.html)

## Project Status
In production.

## Goals/Roadmap
To encourage the creation of new value added services  leveraging the BC Laws API to further enable citizen access to the laws that govern them.
